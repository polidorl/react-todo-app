# To-Do List Application Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a fully-featured, responsive to-do list application with CRUD functionality, a progress indicator, and a modern design.

## Current Plan

### 1. Scaffolding and Dependencies

*   Install `react-icons` for iconography.
*   Create the following component files:
    *   `src/components/TodoForm.jsx`: For adding new tasks.
    *   `src/components/TodoList.jsx`: To display the list of tasks.
    *   `src/components/TodoItem.jsx`: For individual task representation.
*   Create a dedicated CSS file `src/TodoApp.css` for styling.

### 2. Application Logic (in `App.jsx`)

*   Manage the list of tasks using the `useState` hook.
*   Implement functions for:
    *   **Adding a task:** With validation to prevent empty tasks.
    *   **Editing a task:** To update the task's text.
    *   **Completing a task:** To toggle the completion status.
    *   **Deleting a task:** With a confirmation dialog.
*   Calculate the percentage of completed tasks for the progress indicator.

### 3. User Interface (UI)

*   **`TodoForm.jsx`:** An input field and an "Add" button.
*   **`TodoList.jsx`:**
    *   A progress bar to show the completion percentage.
    *   A list of `TodoItem` components.
*   **`TodoItem.jsx`:**
    *   The task text.
    *   "Complete" and "Delete" icon buttons.
    *   Visual distinction for completed tasks.

### 4. Styling (`TodoApp.css`)

*   Apply a modern and visually appealing theme with pleasant colors and clear typography.
*   Ensure the layout is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
*   Use shadows and other effects to create a "lifted" look for cards and interactive elements, as per the design guidelines.

### 5. Error Handling and User Experience

*   Display an alert if the user tries to add an empty task.
*   Use `window.confirm()` to ask for confirmation before deleting a task.
